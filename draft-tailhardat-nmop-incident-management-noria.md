--- abstract

Operational efficiency in incident management on telecom and computer networks requires correlating and interpreting large volumes of heterogeneous technical information.
Knowledge graphs can provide a unified view of complex systems through shared vocabularies.
YANG data models enable describing network configurations and automating their deployment.
However, both approaches face challenges in vocabulary alignment and adoption, hindering knowledge capitalization and sharing on network designs and best practices.
To address this, the concept of a IT Service Management (ITSM) Knowledge Graph (KG) is introduced to leverage existing network infrastructure descriptions in YANG format and enable abstract reasoning on network behaviors.
The key principle to achieve the construction of such ITSM-KG is to transform YANG representations of network infrastructures into an equivalent knowledge graph representation, and then embed it into a more extensive data model for Anomaly Detection (AD) and Risk Management applications.
In addition to use case analysis and design pattern analysis, an experiment is proposed to assess the potential of the ITSM-KG in improving network quality and designs.

# Introduction {#sec-intro}

Incident management on telecom and computer networks, whether it is related to infrastructure or cybersecurity issues, requires the ability to simultaneously and quickly correlate and interpret a large number of heterogeneous technical information sources.
Knowledge graphs, by structuring heterogeneous data through shared vocabularies, enable providing a unified view of complex technical systems, their ecosystem, and the activities and operations related to them (see {{?I-D.marcas-nmop-knowledge-graph-yang}} and {{NORIA-O-2024}}).
Using such formal knowledge representation allows for a simplified interpretation of networks and their behavior, both for NetOps & SecOps teams and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms (e.g. anomaly detection, root cause analysis, diagnostic aid, situation summarization), and paves the way, in line with the Network Digital Twin vision {{?I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch}}, for the development of tools for detecting and analyzing complex network incident situations through explainable, actionable, and shareable models (see {{FOLIO-2018}}, {{SLKG-2023}}, and {{GPL-2024}}).

However, despite potential benefits of using knowledge graphs, these are not mainstream yet in commercial network deployment systems and decision support systems (see {{NORIA-UI-2024}} for more on the decision support systems perspective).
YANG is a widely used standard among operators for describing network configurations and automating their deployment.
Using YANG representations in the form of a KG, as suggested in {{?I-D.marcas-nmop-knowledge-graph-yang}}, would minimize the effort required to adapt network management tools towards the unified vision and applications evoked above.
The lack of alignment between various YANG models on key concepts (e.g. for describing network topology) is, however, hindering this evolution {{?I-D.boucadair-nmop-rfc3535-20years-later}}.

Furthermore, although {{?I-D.netana-nmop-network-anomaly-lifecycle}} addresses the capitalization of incident management knowledge through a YANG model, it can be observed that the overall scope of YANG models does not naturally cover the description of the networks' ecosystem (e.g. physical equipment location, operator organization, supervision systems) or the description of network operations from an IT service management (ITSM) perspective (e.g. business processes and design rules used by the company, scheduled modification operations, remediation actions performed during incident handling).
As a consequence, the continuous improvement of network quality & designs requires additional data cross-referencing operations to properly contextualize incidents and learn from remediation actions taken (e.g. analyzing intervention technicians' verbatim, comparing actions performed on similar incidents but occurring on different networks).
As a result of these additional efforts of contextualization, the capitalization of knowledge typically remains confined at the level of each network operator.
This, in turn, hinders the sharing of information within the community of researchers and system designers regarding failure modes and best practices to adopt, considering the concept of overall improvement of IT systems and the Internet.

Realizing an ITSM knowledge graph for network deployment, anomaly detection and risk management applications has been studied for several years in the Semantic Web community (i.e. knowledge representation and automated reasoning leveraging Web technologies such as {{RDF}}, {{RDFS}}, {{OWL}}, and {{SKOS}}).
Among other examples: the DevOpsInfra ontology {{DevOpsInfra-2021}} allows for describing sets of computing resources and how they are allocated for hosting services; the NORIA-O ontology {{NORIA-O-2024}} allows for describing a network infrastructure & ecosystem, its events, diagnosis and repair actions performed during incident management.
Assuming the continuous integration into a knowledge graph of data from ticketing systems, network monitoring solutions, and network configuration management databases, we remark that the resulting knowledge graph ({{fig-incident-context}}) implicitely holds the necessary information to (automatically) learn incident contexts (i.e. the network topology, its set of states and set of events prior to the incident) and remediation procedures (i.e. the set of actions and network configuration changes carried-out to resolve the incident).

{: #fig-incident-context title="Learning an incident signature seen as a classification model that is trained on the relationship of the incident context (i.e. a subgraph centered around a Resource entity concerned by a given TroubleTicket) to the problem class defined at the TroubleTicket entity level. Arrows are for object properties (owl:ObjectProperty), double line edges are for object class relationships (rdf:type)."}

By going a step further, we notice that a generic understanding of incident context can be extracted and shared among operators from knowledge graphs.
Indeed, a knowledge graph, being an instantiation of shared vocabularies (e.g. RDFS/OWL ontologies and controlled vocabularies in SKOS syntax), sharing incident signatures can be done without revealing infrastructure details (e.g. hostname, IP address), but rather the abstract representation of the network (i.e. the class of the knowledge graph entities and relationships, such as "server" or "router", and or "IPoWDM link").

The remainder of this document is organized as follows.
Firstly, the concept of an ITSM-KG is introduced in {{sec-itsm-base}} towards leveraging existing network infrastructure descriptions in YANG format and enabling abstract reasoning on network behaviors.
The relation of the ITSM-KG proposal to the Digital Map {{?I-D.havel-nmop-digital-map-concept}} is notably discussed in this section.
Secondly, strategies for the ITSM-KG construction are discussed in {{sec-kgc}}.
This include YANG models transformation in {{sec-yang-to-kg}}, implementing alignments of models with the ITSM-KG in {{sec-gluing-techniques}}, and knowledge graph construction pipeline designs in {{sec-etl-kgc}}.
The {{sec-etl-kgc}} notably focuses on addressing the handling of event data streams and providing a unified view for different stakeholders, also known as the data federation architecture.
Finally, an experiment is proposed in {{sec-experiments}} to assess the potential of the ITSM-KG in improving network quality and designs.
The implementation status related to this document is also reported in this section.

# An ITSM-KG for Learning and Sharing Network Behavioral Models {#sec-itsm-base}

## Principles {#sec-itsm-principles}

As evoked in {{sec-intro}}, a detailed characterization of network behavior requires combining several facets of data related both to the configuration of the networks and to their lifecycle, as well as the ecosystem in which they are operated.
In this document, we will consider the following fundamental definitions as a means to achieve the combination of all these facets of data in a convenient way, regardless of their origin, for operational efficiency in incident management and change management with the aid of AI tools:

ITSM-KG:
: A knowledge graph in RDFS/OWL syntax tha enables change management activities, anomaly detection, and risk analysis at the organizational level by combining heterogeneous data sources from the configuration data of the network's structural elements, events occurring on this network, and any other data useful to the business for the effective management of the services provided by this network.

ONTO-ITSM:
: For a given ITSM-KG, the RDFS/OWL ontology that structures the ITSM-KG.

ONTO-YANG-MODEL:
: For a given YANG model, its equivalent RDFS/OWL representation.

ONTO-META:
: An ontology that contributes to structuring some ITSM-KG, regardless of the specifics of a given application domain or ITSM-KG instance, in the sense that it provides an abstract IT Service Management model (i.e. it holds generic concept and property definitions for realizing IT Service Management activities).

ONTO-LINKER:
: For a given (set of) ONTO-YANG-MODEL and a given ONTO-META, the implementation of the equivalence relationships between the key concepts and key properties of the (set of) ONTO-YANG-MODEL and ONTO-META.

Based on these definitions, which will be discussed in more detail later in this document, {{fig-incident-context}} can be seen as an illustration of ITSM-KG from which a subgraph has been extracted, allowing for incident situation to be analyzed through querying.
For example, close to ideas from {{?I-D.netana-nmop-network-anomaly-lifecycle}}, querying the evolution of network entities states from the ITSM-KG during some incident remediation stage could bring to identify the causal graph underlying incident resolution.
As the querying would go through the ONTO-ITSM, the causal graph would de-facto be an abstraction of the situation, thereby enabling knowledge capitalization and sharing for similar incidents that could occur later.

## Relation to the Digital Map {#sec-digital-map}

Similar to the concept of ITSM-KG discussed in this document, the concept of Digital Map discussed in {{?I-D.havel-nmop-digital-map-concept}} emphasizes the need to structure heterogeneous data describing networks in order to simplify network management operations through unified access to this data.
The ITSM-KG can be seen as a meta-knowledge graph that extends the Digital Map concept by adding information about the lifecycle of infrastructures and services, as well as the context of their usage. These additional pieces of information are considered essential for learning shareable activity models of systems.

To clarify this positioning, the following lists ({{sec-digital-map-core}}, {{sec-digital-map-design}}, and {{sec-digital-map-archi}}) reflect the compliance of the meta-KG concept with the Digital Map Requirements defined in {{?I-D.havel-nmop-digital-map-concept}}.
A symbol to the right of each requirement name indicates the nature of compliance: **+** for compatibility, **/** for partial satisfaction, **-** for non-compliance with the requirement.
A comment is provided as necessary.

### Core Requirements {#sec-digital-map-core}

**+** REQ-BASIC-MODEL-SUPPORT:
: nothing to report (n.t.r.)

**+** REQ-LAYERED-MODEL:
: n.t.r.

**/** REQ-PROG-OPEN-MODEL:
: Partially satifying the requirement as the concept of meta-KG mainly relate to the knowledge representation topic rather than to the platform running the Digital Map service on top of the meta-knowledge graph.

**/** REQ-STD-API-BASED:
: Same remark as for REQ-PROG-OPEN-MODEL.

**+** REQ-COMMON-APP:
: n.t.r.

**+** REQ-SEMANTIC:
: n.t.r.

**+** REQ-LAYER-NAVIGATE:
: n.t.r.

**+** REQ-EXTENSIBLE:
: Knowledge graphs implicitly satisfy this requirement, notably with OWL {{OWL}} and SKOS {{SKOS}} constructs if considering RDF knowledge graphs for the meta-KG (e.g. `owl:sameAs` to relate a meta-KG entity to some other entity of another knowledge graph, `owl:equivalentClass` to link concepts and properties used to interpret the meta-KG to concepts and properties from other data models, `skos:inScheme` to group new items of a controled-vocabulary as part of a `skos:ConceptScheme`).

**+** REQ-PLUGG:
: Same remark as for REQ-EXTENSIBLE.

**+** REQ-GRAPH-TRAVERSAL:
: This capability is naturally enabled as the meta-KG concept involves using a graph data structure.

### Design Requirements {#sec-digital-map-design}

**-** REQ-TOPO-ONLY:
: Requirement not satisfied as the meta-KG involves to have more than topological data to interpret and contextualize the network behavior.

**-** REQ-PROPERTIES:
: Same remark as for REQ-TOPO-ONLY.

**-** REQ-RELATIONSHIPS:
: Same remark as for REQ-TOPO-ONLY.

**+** REQ-CONDITIONAL:
: Native, notably considering the expressiveness of SPARQL {{SPARQL11-QL}} if using the Semantic Web protocol stack to run the meta-KG concept.

**+** REQ-TEMPO-HISTO:
: n.t.r.

### Architectural Requirements {#sec-digital-map-archi}

**+** REQ-DM-SCALES:
: This capability applies as we can use data aggregation at the graph level ({{fig-stream-mixed}} and {{fig-stream-mixed-kr}} compared to {{fig-stream-kg-only}} and {{fig-stream-kg-only-kr}}), aggregation without loss of information ({{fig-stream-mixed}} and {{fig-stream-mixed-kr}}), and load balancing (horizontal scaling) by partitioning the meta-KG ({{fig-multi-store}}). Further, ease of integration is enabled thanks to existing standard graph data access protocols (e.g. SPARQL Federated Queries {{SPARQL11-FQ}}, as illustrated in {{fig-multi-store}}).

**/** REQ-DM-DISCOVERY:

# Strategies for the ITSM-KG Construction {#sec-kgc}

In this section, we firstly define in {{sec-yang-to-kg}} two YANG-based data transformation scenario, namely the YANG-KG-SEMANTIC-EQUIVALENCE and YANG-KG-SEMANTIC-GENERALIZATION scenarios.
The YANG-KG-SEMANTIC-GENERALIZATION scenario is then used as a basis in {{sec-gluing-techniques}} to illustrate strategies to reuse YANG models transformed in RDFS/OWL syntax in a higher-level ontology that would structure the ITSM-KG.
Finally, two Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) pipeline approaches and a data federation architecture are presented in {{sec-etl-kgc}} to meet the needs of constructing and exploiting the ITSM-KG.


## From YANG-based Configurations to Meta-Knowledge Graph {#sec-yang-to-kg}

In the following, we consider the use of Semantic Web technologies as the foundation for representing data in the form of a knowledge graph.
We also assume the ability to transform a description of configurations and network infrastructures expressed accordingly to a given (set of) YANG model(s) into a knowledge graph representation.

For the realization of this data transformation, we identify the following scenarios:

YANG-KG-SEMANTIC-EQUIVALENCE:
: The ontology structuring the target knowledge graph is an exact equivalence of the many YANG models organizing the configuration data.

YANG-KG-SEMANTIC-GENERALIZATION:
: The ontology structuring the target KG is a generalization of the YANG models organizing the configuration data.

We note that the YANG-KG-SEMANTIC-EQUIVALENCE case requires a significant knowledge engineering effort to align all YANG models into a coherent ontology with a sufficient level of abstraction to enable the discovery and analysis of emergent behavioral models of networks independently of local configuration specifics.
However, this case has the advantage of being relatively easy to implement based on the available configuration data of an operator, for example, by implementing {{RML}} rules for constructing a knowledge graph from this data.

For the YANG-KG-SEMANTIC-GENERALIZATION case, we observe that the transformation effort involves:

1. Being able to transform YANG models into their RDFS/OWL equivalent to provide a consistent interpretation of configuration data in a knowledge graph that aligns with each data source.
2. Being able to provide a generalized interpretation of these transformed YANG models by identifying alignments between key concepts in these models and those in a more expressive ontology.

As an example, the YANG-KG-SEMANTIC-GENERALIZATION case could involve wanting to integrate Service and Network topology data, matching the Network Topologies {{!RFC8345}} and Service Assurance {{!RFC9418}} YANG data models, into a knowledge graph structured by the NORIA-O ontology {{NORIA-O-2024}}.

Although identifying alignments in the YANG-KG-SEMANTIC-GENERALIZATION case may appear non-trivial for "constructor" YANG models, it is worth noting that the design of YANG models generally relies on principles of concept hierarchies and reuse of common concepts between models to promote model interoperability, as is the case with the Abstract Network Model of {{!RFC8345}}.
Therefore, the task of identifying alignments can theoretically benefit from these design principles.

In continuity of the above RFC8345 / NORIA-O example, providing an alignment may mean asserting a semantic equivalence between the RDFS/OWL representation of the "node" concept from {{!RFC8345}} with the "noria:Resource" concept from {{NORIA-O-2024}}.
Examples of approaches for linking ontologies are provided in {{sec-gluing-techniques}}.


## Implementing Alignments of Model-Specificities to a Multi-Faceted Knowledge Graph {#sec-gluing-techniques}

Building on the previously defined YANG-KG-SEMANTIC-GENERALIZATION scenario, this section presents two approaches to construct the structuring ontology of the ITSM-KG by combining YANG models translated into RDFS/OWL and a meta-ontology enabling the analysis of the operational context of the network lifecycle.
As techniques for identifying alignments between data models is beyond the scope of this document, we refer interested readers to specialized literature in this field, such as {{ONTO-MATCH-2022}}.

To present the approaches, we assume the ability to convert a given YANG model into its ONTO-YANG-MODEL (i.e. its equivalent RDFS/OWL representation).
The code snippet in {{snippet-ietf-network-node}} is a fictional example of translating the "node" concept from {{!RFC8345}} into its RDFS/OWL equivalent.

The following sub-sections build on the ONTO-YANG-MODEL example from {{snippet-ietf-network-node}}.

### The Network of Ontologies Approach {#sec-network-of-ontologies}

The network of ontologies approach is a common practice in the field of knowledge engineering and Semantic Web technologies.
The principle involves assembling vocabularies from different domains to form a coherent set, for example to infer - through graph traversal or reasoning - relationships between entities in the graph, starting from a concept defined in one of the vocabularies and leading to an instance of a concept from another vocabulary.

In our example, the code snippet of {{snippet-onto-itsm}} implements the ONTO-ITSM by importing concepts from the ONTO-YANG-MODEL ({{snippet-ietf-network-node}}) and concepts from the ONTO-META ({{snippet-noria-o-as-it-is}}).
An additional import in {{snippet-onto-linker}} relates to the ONTO-LINKER.

### Explicit Linking in the ONTO-META {#sec-linking-in-onto-meta}

In this approach, we assume that we have the means to evolve ONTO-META, which allows for the implementation of equivalence relationships between the concepts of ONTO-META and ONTO-YANG-MODEL directly within ONTO-META, as shown in {{snippet-noria-o-extended}}.

In this sense, ONTO-ITSM is part of ONTO-META, and ONTO-LINKER is within ONTO-META.
The query in {{snippet-sparql-equivalent}} applies here as well and will yield the same results.

## Extract-Transform-Load Pipelines for the ITSM-KG {#sec-etl-kgc}

Based on {{?I-D.marcas-nmop-knowledge-graph-yang}} and {{NORIA-DI-2023}}, which present the technical means to implement a pipeline for constructing the ITSM-KG, this section focuses on two complementary viewpoints:
{{sec-etl-kgc-streams}} the management of streaming data such as alarms and logs,
and {{sec-etl-kgc-fq}} the deployment of a federated data architecture when various technical foundations or business units are involved in providing the ITSM-KG.

From the perspective of the Digital Map Requirements ({{sec-digital-map}}), the {{fig-stream-mixed}}, {{fig-stream-mixed-kr}} and {{fig-multi-store}} particularly address the REQ-DM-SCALES requirement.

### Handling Event Streams {#sec-etl-kgc-streams}

The following figures illustrate different scenarios for constructing a ITSM-KG through an Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) data integration pipeline.

{{fig-stream-kg-only}} illustrates a common design pattern providing the capability to record event streams into a knowledge graph, such as an ITMS-KG if considering that event data are mapped to ONTO-META concepts and network entities to ONTO-YANG-MODEL concepts.
The {{fig-stream-kg-only-kr}} provides an example of the resulting representation in the form of a knowledge graph.

As event streams can be high-paced, it could be beneficial to leverage input/output (I/O) performance optimizations specific to each type of database management system (DBMS), such as Time-Series DataBases (TSDBs) for streaming data and graph databases for knowledge graphs.
{{fig-stream-mixed}} illustrates the capability to handle both a knowledge graph and a time-series representation of the network's lifecycle while maintaining a link between the two representations ({{fig-stream-mixed-kr}}).
Each serve different purposes, such as context analysis with the knowledge graph representation and trend analysis with the TSDB.
Thanks to the linking between the two storage systems, users browsing aggregated data from the knowledge graph can access the raw data within the relevant time span for further analysis, and vice versa.

# Experiments {#sec-experiments}

## Experimental Plan {#sec-experiments-plan}

In terms of experimentation, we consider the YANG-KG-SEMANTIC-GENERALIZATION case defined in {{sec-kgc}} as the reference approach and recommend implementing a data processing pipeline that performs the following use cases:

Y-MODEL-FROM-DATA:
: Based on a dataset of configuration data expressed in YANG models, the goal is to enable extracting the list of models involved for their conversion to their RDFS/OWL equivalent.

Y-MODEL-DEPENDENCIES:
: Based on a given YANG model, the goal is to enable identifying and retrieving all the YANG models that the model refers to, in order to build a complete corpus of models for their conversion to their RDFS/OWL equivalent as a coherent set.

Y-MODEL-TO-RDFS-OWL:
: Based on a YANG model and the associated model corpus (i.e. Y-MODEL-DEPENDENCIES), the goal is to enable producing a semantically equivalent RDFS/OWL representation (i.e. ONTO-YANG-MODEL).
: Ideally, a YANG to RDFS/OWL/YANG projection algebra would be used to provide a formal proof of semantic equivalence; testing mechanisms should be implemented as a fallback to provide a proof of equivalence.

Y-INSTANCE-TO-KG:
: Based on a dataset of configuration data expressed in YANG models and the related (set of) ONTO-YANG-MODEL, the goal is to enable constructing a knowledge graph from the configuration data, with the knowledge graph structured by the (set of) ONTO-YANG-MODEL.

Y-MODEL-META-KG-ALIGNMENT:
: Based on a corpus of YANG models transformed into RDFS/OWL (i.e. Y-MODEL-TO-RDFS-OWL) and a reference ontology structuring the ITSM-KG, the goal is to enable querying of the configuration entities present in the graph (i.e. data derived from the Y-INSTANCE-TO-KG case) through the concepts of the reference ontology.
: In addition to identifying the class and property correspondences between the resulting Y-MODEL-TO-RDFS-OWL models and the reference ontology, this capability requires implementing a necessary and sufficient number of class equivalence relations and property equivalence relations.

META-KG-BEHAVIORAL-MODEL:
: Based on the ITSM-KG, which results from the composition of the Y-INSTANCE-TO-KG case with Y-MODEL-META-KG-ALIGNMENT and additional operational data structured by ONTO-META, the goal is to learn behavioral models (e.g. incident signatures) in a formalism that can be interpreted through the lenses of ONTO-ITSM and shared with other stakeholders with minimal discrepancies in the underlying configuration data.

## Implementation Status {#sec-exp-status}

This section provides pointers to existing open source implementations of this document or in close relation to it.

### NORIA {#sec-exp-noria}

The NORIA project aims at enabling advanced network anomaly detection using knowledge graphs.
Among the components resulting from this project, the following ones serve the use case described in this document:

* NORIA-O {{NORIA-O-2024}}, is a data model for IT networks, events and operations information.
The ontology is developed using web technologies (e.g. RDF, OWL, SKOS) and is intended as a structure for realizing an ITSM knowledge graph for Anomaly Detection (AD) and Risk Management applications.
The NORIA-O implementation is available as open source at [https://w3id.org/noria/](https://w3id.org/noria/).
Its use for anomaly detection is discussed in:
  - {{SLKG-2023}} with a model-based design approach (i.e. query the graph to retrieve anomalies and their context) and a statistical learning approach (i.e. relate entities based on context
similarities, then use this relatedness to alert and guide the repair).
  - {{GPL-2024}} with a process mining approach to align a sequence of entities to activity models, then use this relatedness to guide the repair actions.
  - {{NORIA-UI-2024}} a Web-based knowledge graph exploration design for incident management that combines the above {{SLKG-2023}} and {{GPL-2024}} techniques for broader coverage of anomaly cases and knowledge capitalization.

* A knowledge graph-based platform design {{NORIA-DI-2023}} using Semantic Web technologies and open source data integration tools to build an ITSM knowledge graph:
  - SMASSIF-RML, a Semantic Web stream processing solution with declarative data mapping capability. Available as open source at [https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/smassif-rml](https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/smassif-rml).
  - ssb-consum-up, a Kafka to SPARQL gateway enabling end-to-end Semantic Web data flow architecture with a Semantic Service Bus (SSB) approach. Available as open source at [https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/ssb-consum-up](https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/ssb-consum-up).
  - grlc, a fork of CLARIAH/grlc with SPARQL UPDATE and GitLab interface features to facilitate the call and versioning of stored user queries in SPARQL syntax (e.g. for anomaly detection following the model-based design approach). Available as open source at [https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/grlc](https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/grlc).

* SemNIDS {{SemNIDS-2023}}, a test bench involving network trafic generation, open source Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS), knowledge graphs, process mining and conformance checking components.

Note that the NORIA project does not currently address the Y-MODEL-FROM-DATA, Y-MODEL-DEPENDENCIES, and Y-MODEL-TO-RDFS-OWL use cases.

### YANG2OWL {#sec-exp-yang2owl}

The YANG2OWL framework aims at facilitating the implementation of a Network Digital Twin (NDT) that would leverage the representation and reasoning capabilities typically associated with knowledge graphs for anomaly detection needs, as well as for network management purposes by enabling network configuration based on modifications at the level of the ITSM-KG itself.
Basically, the approach consists of reusing YANG data models used in network operations in a nearly equivalent form within Semantic Web technologies (i.e. producing ONTO-YANG-MODEL instances) to create a bijection between network configuration data and the NDT.

The YANG2OWL framework addresses the use cases Y-MODEL-TO-RDFS-OWL and Y-INSTANCE-TO-KG (as defined in {{sec-experiments-plan}}).

{{fig-yang2owl-framework}} illustrates the top-level tasks of the semantization process at play.
In the following sections, we provide details about how the framework enables building ontologies that captures the specificities of the telco domain and for using these ontologies to model any telco network instance as an ITSM-KG.
Please note that the publication of the related tools and algorithms is in progress.

#### Motivations and Principles {#sec-exp-yang2owl-motivations}

The document {{?I-D.mackey-nmop-kg-for-netops}} (Knowledge Graph Framework for Network Operations) highlights the importance of using ontologies, in addition to using knowledge graphs for enabling the vision of network management automation.
Whereas the document put forward the advantage of using ontologies to base the knowledge graphs on, it doesn’t say anything about how to create these ontologies.
There isn’t either much details about how the knowledge graphs should be generated or how both the ontologies and the knowledge graphs will relate to each other.

Our proposal is that:

1. The ontologies should intimately reflect YANG models,
2. The generation of ontologies should be mostly automatized,
3. The knowledge graphs should intimately reflect the payload of messages that YANG compliant network equipments and controlers publish or emit in response to a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) request,
4. The generation of knowledge graphs should be automated,
5. The nodes and predicates of the knowledge graphs should be defined as instances of classes and properties of the ontologies.

We claim that point 1 of our proposal is necessary in order to ensure the adhesion of Network Management operators and expert in the semantic technology.
Actually, it is of paramount importance to align the vocabulary of the ontology (the naming of classes and relationships) and the semantics defined by the ontology (the constraints on the use of relationships) with the vocabulary of network managers.
It has been recognized that today the YANG language has been the reference in this area.
This will be even more true in the future as YANG has been specified in the framework of IETF and backed by the major industrial actors of the telco domain.
This has been the incent of our developing a tool for converting YANG models into OWL models which is point 2 of our proposal.
Point 3, 4 and 5 are direct consequences of our committing to point 1 and 2.

#### The Y-MODEL-TO-RDFS-OWL step {#sec-exp-yang2owl-oc}

YANG and OWL are both data modeling languages.
They define a vocabulary and a grammar.
The vocabulary defines the concept of the domain. YANG domain is the telco domain.

In a natural language, the vocabulary defines nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs that are useful for discussing the world.
The grammar specifies how these elements should be assembled into sentences that describe a state of the world.
In a YANG model, the vocabulary is defined in terms of *containers*, *lists*, *leaves*, *leaf lists*, and other categories, while the grammar is defined in terms of statements that relate these elements to one another.
In an OWL ontology, the vocabulary is defined in terms of *classes*, *subclasses*, *object properties*, and *data properties*, which is somewhat similar to YANG but does not directly map.

As ontologies have been introduced as a modeling language meant to share a common view (or knowledge) of a domain among different stakeholders {{GRUBER-1995}}, the terms defined by the ontologies should reflect those used by equipment manufacturers, telecom solutions developers, systems integrators, network operators, and ultimately end users.

A YANG model is a document containing declarations.
The document has a tree-like structure: declarations can contain other declarations.
There are about half hundred types of declarations.
The main ones are *container*, *list*, *leaf* and *leaflist*:

CONTAINER:
: It is a concept, something we can talk about, it's basic type of element of the domain, such as a network, a node, a link. A container declaration can contain another container declaration that can be called a sub-container. This sub-container allows to define a concept that will characterize the container that contains it (e.g., link, source, and destination).

LIST:
: It is a concept that can have multiple instances, such as nodes of a network.

LEAF:
: It is a property of this concept, such as an identifier or a geographical location.

LEAFLIST:
: It is a multivalued property, such as hours of the day the device is put on sleep mode.

By applying the above principles, and in line with the reasons sketched in {{sec-exp-yang2owl-motivations}}, we have developed the YANG2OWL that automatically generates OWL ontologies from YANG modules (i.e. computes ONTO-YANG-MODELs).
{{fig-yang2owl-flow}} sketches the use of the YANG2OWL tool to compute the org.opendaylight.yangtools ONTO-YANG-MODEL.

{: #fig-yang2owl-flow title="Computing the org.opendaylight.yangtools ONTO-YANG-MODEL with YANG2OWL."}

#### The Y-INSTANCE-TO-KG step {#sec-exp-yang2owl-kgc}

As introduced earlier, YANG models define the vocabulary and grammar to describe factual knowledge about the state of the network.
For example if a YANG module defines the container *node*, and this container has a leaf *identifier* which has the type *string*, then a valid JSON document with configuration data describing a node should be a JSON object containing a key named *identifier* which value should be a *string* such as *router_253*.

So, in line with the mapping rules of YANG statement into OWL concepts defined in {{sec-exp-yang2owl-oc}}, when parsing a JSON tree that comply to a given YANG model when can assume that if we get a *key which value is a JSON object* then the *key should be the name of a container or a list* and its *value should be a description to be further analyzed*.
Thus, in terms of knowledge graph modeling, this JSON object should be interpreted as an *instance of a class* which name is the *name of the container or of the list*.

Conversely, if the value is a *litteral*, the *key* should be the *name of a leaf or a leaflist*.
Thus, in terms of knowledge graph modeling, the litteral should be interpreted as the *object of a DataProperty* which name is the *name of the leaf*.

The JSON2RDF tool (which is part of the YANG2OWL framework) implements these principles, realizing the Y-INSTANCE-TO-KG use case.
{{snippet-json2rdf-pseudocode}} shows the algorithm implemented by JSON2RDF as pseudo code.

~~~
function createURI(jsonObject, class, namespace, ontology) {
  if class has a 'key' annotation {
    get the content <keycontent> of this annotation
    search the key <keycontent> in the jsonObject
    use the namespace and the value of this key to create the URI
  } else {
    generate a unique URI
  }
  return the URI created
}

function createObject(URI, class) {
  return an instance of the class with the given URI
}

function parse(object, parentURI, class, namespace, ontology) {
  objectURI = createURI(object,class, namespace, ontology)
  createObject(objectURI, class)
  for each key of object {
    if the value of object[key] is a list {
      for each elt of the list {
        if elt is an object {
          parse(elt, objectURI, key, namespace, ontology)*
          create the triple <objectURI haskey elt>
        } else if elt is a literal
create the triple <objectURI key elt>
    } else if the value of object[key] is an object {
        eltURI = createURI(elt,key, namespace, ontology)
        create the triple <objectURI haskey eltURI>
        parse(elt, objectURI, key, namespace, ontology)
    } else if the value of object[key] is literal {
        create the triple <objectURI key value>
    }
  }
}
~~~
{: #snippet-json2rdf-pseudocode title="Pseudo code of the algorithm implemented by JSON2RDF."}

The algorithm is initiated by calling the *parse* function (in Java, it should be called in the *main* method) as follows, where _top_ is the root of the JSON object (i.e. configuration data as a JSON tree that complies to a given YANG model), and *ontology* is the output of the Y-MODEL-TO-RDFS-OWL step:

~~~
call parse(top, nil, namespace, ontology)
~~~

#### Example of Implementation {#sec-exp-yang2owl-uc}

To illustrate the YANG2OWL approach, we briefly report below on an experiment conducted with real world data from a virtualized 5G infrastructure.
In the context of the Network Change Management process, *impact analysis* prior to conducting a scheduled operation can be run on an ITSM-KG.
It aims to determine all the components of the 5G core network that are dependent on a given (set of) network infrastructure element.
For example, for a scheduled operation on a leaf node (i.e. a network element in a 2-tier spine-leaf architecture), the impact calculus will return all the servers connected to the leaf, all the Virtual Machines (VMs) hosted on these servers, all the Network Functions (NFs) deployed on these VMs, and ideally all the telecom services using these NFs.

{{fig-yang2owl-experiment}} provides an overview of the data processing workflow used for the experiment.
The tasks of the diagram are described below.

{: #fig-yang2owl-experiment title="Flowchart for the YANG2OWL experiment. A left vertical bar on a step indicates that it is scripted; otherwise, steps require user or operator action."}

Model Gathering:
: This task corresponds to the realization of the Y-MODEL-FROM-DATA use case with the manual selection of YANG modules in relation to the 3GPP application domain.
The following YANG modules have been selected: xxx, xxx, xxx.

Model Translation:
: It realizes the Y-MODEL-DEPENDENCIES use case using xxxx, and the Y-MODEL-TO-RDFS-OWL use case using the YANG2OWL solution as defined in {{sec-exp-yang2owl-oc}}.
For this experiment, the resulting ontology is called MOBILE-O.

Model Curation:
: This task involves providing a streamlined ontology by manually *filtering* (selection of classes and relationships based on the data available) and *grouping* (compression of the model hierarchy, i.e. class of classes) the model resulting from the *Model Translation* task.
This simplification aims to enhance the readability of the model for an operator and facilitate the implementation of potentially more concise queries in the downstream *Use Cases-Related Querying* task.

Model-Related Knowledge Graph Construction:
: It realizes the Y-INSTANCE-TO-KG use case using the JSON2RDF solution as defined in {{sec-exp-yang2owl-kgc}}.

NetOps-Related Knowledge Graph Construction:
: This task corresponds to the execution of RML transformation rules {{RML}} with definitions from the NORIA-O ontology {{NORIA-O-2024}} for the integration of complementary data to that of the 5G network derived from YANG configurations (i.e. the *Model-Related Knowledge Graph Construction* task), such as the topology of connected networks, scheduled operations, incident tickets, and organization-related data.

Global Knowledge Graph Construction:
: It is achieved through parallel insertions into a graph database of the results from the *Model-Related* and *NetOps-Related* tasks, after ensuring that:
1) the URI patterns implemented in the RML rules of the NetOps-Related step are consistent with the URIs produced by the Model-Related step to benefit from automatic linking of triples within the graph database through the uniqueness of the URIs;
2) the definition of mappings between MOBILE-O and NORIA-O has been implemented and inserted into the graph database (i.e. realization of the Y-MODEL-META-KG-ALIGNMENT use case through the implementation of the ONTO-LINKER concept as illustrated in {{snippet-onto-linker}}).
For this experiment, the graph database is a Neo4J instance, and the loading is performed using the Neosemantics tool.

Use Cases-Related Pre-Processing:
: Dependency relationships are, in general, knowledge elements that cannot be directly derived from field data; they are part of the business knowledge regarding the operation of the equipment.
It may therefore be beneficial to support the use case by performing pre-processing, particularly by calculating these dependency relationships retrospectively from business rules and the data loaded into the database.
For example, one can create a *server DEPENDS_ON leaf* relationship by searching instances of the (Server)–(Server Interface)–(Network Link)–(Leaf Interface)–(Leaf) graph pattern.
The same principle is applied to different network configurations to create the dependency relationships.
For this experiment, the dependency relationships are calculated directly in the graph database using Cypher language queries, or externally to the graph database using SHACL shapes {{SHACL}} according to the principles described in {{GUITTOUM-2023}}.

#### Discussion {#sec-exp-yang2owl-discussion}

The YANG2OWL approach is complementary to the YANG2RDF approach {{YANG2RDF-IETF-121}}, which consists in translating YANG models into RDF.
More specifically, YANG2RDF defines an ontology of the YANG language, where RDF graph instances model a YANG module.
This approach is useful for querying YANG models.
In contrast, the YANG2OWL approach defines an ontology of a YANG model, where RDF graph instances model an operational network.

# Security Considerations

As this document covers the *ITSM-KG* concepts, and use cases, there is no specific security considerations.

However, as the concept of a meta-knowledge graph involves the construction of a multi-faceted graph (i.e. including network topologies, operational data, and service and client data), it poses the risk of simplifying access to network operational data and functions that fall outside the knowledge graph users' responsibility or that could facilitate the intervention of malicious individuals.
To support the discussion on mitigating this risk, we suggest referring to {{fig-multi-store}}, which illustrates the concept of partial access to the meta-knowledge graph based on rights associated with each user group (UG) at the data domain level.
We also recommend referring to {{AMO-2012}} for an example of implementation of access rights in a content management system that relies on Semantic Web models and technologies.
This implementation uses the AMO ontology, which includes a set of classes and properties for annotating resources that require access control, as well as a base of inference rules that model the access management strategy to carry out.
